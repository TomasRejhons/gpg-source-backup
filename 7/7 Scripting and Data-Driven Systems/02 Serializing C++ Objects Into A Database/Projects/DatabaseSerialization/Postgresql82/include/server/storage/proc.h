 * the PGPROC is linked into that lock's waitProcs queue.  A recycled PGPROC
 * is linked into ProcGlobal's freeProcs list.
 *
 * Note: twophase.c also sets up a dummy PGPROC struct for each currently
 * prepared transaction.  These PGPROCs appear in the ProcArray data structure
 * so that the prepared transactions appear to be still running and are
 * correctly shown as holding locks.  A prepared transaction PGPROC can be
 * distinguished from a real one at need by the fact that it has pid == 0.
 * The semaphore and lock-activity fields in a prepared-xact PGPROC are unused,
 * but its myProcLocks[] lists are valid.
